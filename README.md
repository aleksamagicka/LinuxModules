## Overview

This is a hwmon Linux kernel driver supporting the following Aquacomputer devices:

|     Quadro     |          6.0           | Temperature, flow and fan sensors, direct fan PWM control |  MCF51JU128VHS  |
| High Flow Next |     Available here     |                      Various sensors                      |        /        |

The above table shows what devices this driver supports and starting from which kernel version, if applicable. Microcontrollers are noted for general reference, as this driver only communicates through HID reports and does not interact with the device CPU & electronics directly.

Being a standard `hwmon` driver, it provides readings via `sysfs`, which are easily accessible through `lm-sensors` as usual. Here's example output for some of the devices:

## Repository contents

Only notable parts are listed:

* _aquacomputer_d5next.c_ - the driver itself
* [Reverse engineering docs](re-docs) - WIP, documents explaining how the devices communicate to help understand what the driver does

* [Kernel docs](docs) - driver documentation for the kernel

## Installation and usage

Ideally, you are on a recent kernel and your distro includes it. If that's the case, you should already have this driver available! Refer to the table in the overview above to check.

If you're not, or your kernel does not have the driver support for your particular device, you can clone this repository and compile the driver yourself.
